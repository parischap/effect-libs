## EFFECT-LIBS

effect-libs is a set of open-source libraries to be used in complement to the [Effect](https://effect.website/docs/introduction) library.

The [pretty-print](docs/pretty-print) module however may be used by non-Effect users.

Each package contains its own documentation. You may also take a look at our [API](https://parischap.github.io/effect-libs/).
