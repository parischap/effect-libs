## EFFECT-LIBS

effect-libs is a set of open-source libraries to be used in complement to the [Effect](https://effect.website/docs/introduction) library.

Although developped in Effect for Effect users, all packages may be used by non-Effect users.

Each package contains its own documentation.

You may also take a look at our [API](https://parischap.github.io/effect-libs/).
