# conversions

An [`Effect`](https://effect.website/docs/introduction) library to partially replace the native javascript INTL API.

Non machine-dependent, safe, bidirectional (implements parsing and formatting), tested, documented, with lots of examples, 100% Typescript, 100% functional.

Can also come in handy to non-`Effect` users.

## Installation

Depending on the package manager you use, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

- **Using npm:**

  ```sh
  npm install effect @parischap/effect-lib @parischap/conversions
  ```

- **Using pnpm:**

  ```sh
  pnpm add effect @parischap/effect-lib @parischap/conversions
  ```

- **Using yarn:**
  ```sh
  yarn add effect @parischap/effect-lib @parischap/conversions
  ```

We use two peerDependencies. If you are not an `Effect` user, the size may seem important. But, in fact, we use little of each peerDependency. Bundled and tree-shaken, this module is only about [69kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@parischap/conversions). Minified and gzipped, it falls to [15kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@parischap/conversions)! (source bundlephobia)

## API

After reading this introduction, you may take a look at the [API](https://parischap.github.io/effect-libs/docs/conversions) documentation.

## In this package

This package contains:

- a [module to round numbers and BigDecimal's](./readme-assets/Rounding.md) with the same rounding options as those offered by the javascript INTL API: Ceil, Floor, Expand, Trunc, HalfCeil...
- a safe, easy-to-use [number/BigDecimal parser/formatter](./readme-assets/NumberParserFormatter.md) with almost all the options offered by the javascript INTL API: choice of the thousand separator, of the fractional separator, of the minimum and maximum number of fractional digits, of the rounding mode, of the sign display mode, of whether to show or not the integer part when it's zero, of whether to use a scientific or engineering notation, of the character to use as exponent mark... It can also be used as a `Schema` instead of the `Effect.Schema.NumberFromString` transformer.
- an equivalent to the PHP [sprintf and sscanf functions](./readme-assets/Templating.md) with real typing of the placeholders. Although `Effect.Schema` does offer the [`TemplateLiteralParser` API](https://effect.website/docs/schema/basic-usage/#templateliteralparser), the latter does not provide a solution to situations such as fixed length fields (potentially padded), numbers formatted otherwise than in the English format... This module can also be used as a `Schema`.
- a very easy to use [DateTime module](./readme-assets/DateTime.md) that implements natively the Iso calendar (Iso year and Iso week). It is also faster than its `Effect` counterpart as it implements an internal state that's only used to speed up calculation times (but does not alter the result of functions; so `CVDateTime` functions can be viewed as pure from a user's perspective). It can therefore be useful in applications where time is of essence.
- a [DateTime parser/formatter](./readme-assets/DateTimeFormatter.md) which supports many of the available [unicode tokens](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table). It can also be used as a `Schema` instead of the `Effect.Schema.Date` transformer.
- a few [brands](./readme-assets/Branding.md) which come in handy in many projects such as email, semantic versioning, integer numbers, positive integer numbers, real numbers and positive real numbers. All these brands are also defined as `Schemas`. Please read the [`Effect` documentation about Branding](https://effect.website/docs/code-style/branded-types/) if you are not familiar with this concept

Most functions of this package return an `Either` or an `Option` to signify the possibility of an error. However, if you are not an `Effect` user and do not care to learn more about it, you can simply use the `OrThrow` variant of the function. For instance, use `CVDateTime.setWeekdayOrThrow` instead of `CVDateTime.setWeekday`. As its name suggests, it will throw in case failure. Some functions return functions that return an `Either` or throw. In that case, the variant for non-`Effect` users contains the word `Throwing`, e.g. use `CVDateTimeFormat.toThrowingFormatter` instead of `CVDateTimeFormat.toFormatter`.
