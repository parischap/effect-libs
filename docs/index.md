effect-libs is a set of open-source libraries to be used in complement to the effect library.

It offers Date and number parsing/formatting, sscanf/sprintf templating, number rounding, object pretty-printing, and ansi-colors for terminal printing.

It also enriches the Effect library, in particular the Array, String, Struct, and RegExp modules, with some very useful combinators. It provides a simplified matcher that will painlessly handle most situations and a non-recursive tree implementation that safely handles cycles.
